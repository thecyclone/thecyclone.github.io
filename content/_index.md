Hi, I'm Akash,

I am an Applied Scientist at [Ownwell](https://www.ownwell.com/) where I spearhead initiatives in the development, implementation, and operationalization of machine learning models. My responsibilities extend from the development of predictive models for housing prices and document processing to fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for custom tasks.

Before my current role, I was a Ph.D. student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

Please feel free to [get in touch](mailto:akash.a283@gmail.com)!
